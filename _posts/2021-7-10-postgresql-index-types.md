Postgres provides many index types such as B-tree, hash, GiST, and GIN. This article is about commons indexes like B-Tree and Hash to tell what is difference and which one should use for the situation. GiST and GIN are indexes for supporting Full-Text Search which I'll explain in the new blog post.

## Hash index

Hash index is probably the fastest and the simplest index with O(1) the data will store in hashmap structure. for example when you query and the key index hit the hash map will return address to data storage is instantly. Hash index in Postgres doesn't support composite or multi-columns index and Hash index don't have ability for ordering or select between range, but B-tree index can make the job.

### Examples

Prepare schema and Create an Hash indexes for first_name and last_name.

```SQL
CREATE TABLE persons (
  id int PRIMARY KEY,
  first_name text,
  last_name text
);

CREATE INDEX first_name_idx ON persons USING hash (first_name);
CREATE INDEX last_name_idx ON persons USING hash (last_name);

INSERT INTO persons VALUES
    (1, 'john', 'doe');
INSERT INTO persons VALUES
    (2, 'jane', 'doe');
INSERT INTO persons VALUES
    (3, 'jack', 'doe');
INSERT INTO persons VALUES
    (4, 'john', 'connor');
```

persons table

| id (PK) | first_name | last_name |
| ------- | ---------- | --------- |
| 1       | john       | doe       |
| 2       | jane       | doe       |
| 3       | jack       | doe       |
| 4       | john       | connor    |

Example 1. When query by column

```SQL
EXPLAIN SELECT * FROM persons WHERE last_name='doe';
```

The query will hit `last_name_idx` index and the index will return all addresses to all rows which last_name is 'doe' instantly.

Example 2. When query by multi columns

```SQL
EXPLAIN SELECT * FROM persons WHERE first_name='john' AND last_name='doe';
```

The query will using `first_name_idx` index and `last_name_idx` index. I have no idea why it checks `last_name_idx` first. I tried to swap where condition but the plan still the same.

## B-Tree index

B-tree index will store data in tree structure that allow for sorted, search, and sequence data in O(log n). B-tree structure is not like normal binary search tree, a node can have more than one key and more than two children. That's why B-tree is suit for database because allow more complexity in search condition.

### Examples

Prepare schema and Create an B-Tree indexes for salary and multi columns index with age and salary.

```SQL
CREATE TABLE employees (
  id int PRIMARY KEY,
  name text,
  salary int,
  age int
);

CREATE INDEX salary_idx ON employees USING btree (salary);
CREATE INDEX age_salary_idx ON employees USING btree (age, salary);

INSERT INTO employees VALUES
    (1, 'john', 3000, 25);
INSERT INTO employees VALUES
    (2, 'jane', 1000, 30);
INSERT INTO employees VALUES
    (3, 'jack', 2000, 40);
INSERT INTO employees VALUES
    (4, 'jill', 5000, 50);
```

employees table

| id (PK) | name | salary | age |
| ------- | ---- | ------ | --- |
| 1       | john | 3000   | 25  |
| 2       | jane | 1000   | 25  |
| 3       | jack | 2000   | 40  |
| 3       | jill | 5000   | 25  |

Example 1. When query all ordering by index

```SQL
EXPLAIN SELECT * FROM employees ORDER BY salary;
```

the query will using index `salary_idx` to order all employees.

Example 2. When query all ordering by composite index

```SQL
EXPLAIN SELECT * FROM employees ORDER BY age;
```

the query will use index `age_salary_idx` to order all employees. This proves that the multi-columns index can also order by one field.

Example 3. When query by a column using index

```SQL
EXPLAIN SELECT * FROM employees WHERE salary = 3000;
```

As the query plan after the index hit still needs to bitmap Heap scan after and it took 4.20..13.67 cost which means startup cost is 4.2 and the total cost is 13.67. that is why the b-tree index is not O(1).

Example 4. When query by multiple column using composite index

```SQL
EXPLAIN SELECT * FROM employees WHERE age = 25 AND salary = 3000;
```

This is a bit surprising. when query exactly multi-columns to the composite index after it hit the index it will return the result instantly. This is probably O(1) in this situation.

## Conclusion

The key point is to create an index base on the queries you are using. B-tree for ordering query and hash for non-ordering. You can create many indexes as you want to improve the read performance. The disk space or the block size might not a big deal nowadays. Once a query doesn't hit any index and it's often used, you should consider how to indexing it.
