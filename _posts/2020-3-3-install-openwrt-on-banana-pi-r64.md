This tutorial is a getting start to build OpenWRT image and install on Banana Pi R64, This guide also works with the Banana Pi R2 but it will be a difference in some steps.

## What is Banana Pi R64

The Banana Pi R64 is a router-based development board running with ARM Chipset MediaTek MT7622. So you can install operating systems which support to this ARM CPU including OpenWrt, Ubuntu, or many Linux distributions. It has many interfaces support such as on board Wifi/Bluetooth, 1GB Ethernet, USB 3.0, 40 GPIO, etc. Banana Pi R64 can add a Mini-PCI Express Modules and PoE module. And It also has a performance, resource, and interfaces good enough to be a high-end router.

### Banana Pi R64 Specifications

- MediaTek MT7622,1.35GHZ 64 bit dual-core ARM Cortex-A53
- 1G DDR3 SDRAM

- MTK7615 4x4ac wifi on board
- Support 1 SATA interface
- MicroSD slot supports up to 256GB expansion
- 8G eMMC flash (option 16/32/64G)
- 5 port 10/100/1000 Mb Ethernet port
- 1 Port USB 3.0
- Slow I/O:ADC, Audio Amplifier, GPIO, I2C, I2S, IR, PMIC I/F, PWM, RTC, SPI, UART
- POE function support

## Requirements

- macOS (I used 10.15.3) *for Ubuntu, will easier to build the image
- Banana Pi R64
- MicroSD Card
- MicroSD Card Reader
- USB to UART

## Preparation

### Install USB to UART Driver

Just follow this link if you're using FTDI

<https://learn.sparkfun.com/tutorials/how-to-install-ftdi-drivers/all>

here is for CP2102

<https://www.silabs.com/products/development-tools/software/usb-to-uart-bridge-vcp-drivers>

### Terminal software for serial

you can use whatever serial console Putty, screen, minicom

for this tutorial I use `screen`

### Download images

#### SD card image

<https://drive.google.com/open?id=1Ap7lt-pjpG-pAOAEqpH13-SMOSkRkZI0>

#### eMMC all-in-one single image

includes GPT, ATF, u-boot, and Linux kernel image

<https://drive.google.com/open?id=1w8kO3klbPfdHK6lTI8Ub8sR_7ViISORM>

#### eMMC preloader

<https://drive.google.com/open?id=1Fy__GpNSWRcITEmzH4Z_jxnjrCS3BpQJ>

## Setup boot from eMMC

this step will allow you to build image to eMMC storage on the board instead sd card

### Write SD card image into SD card

You need to boot via sd card first to write preloader and eMMC all-in-one single image

`dd if=sdcardimage.img of=/dev/sdX`

replace `sdX` with your drive

### Run TFTP server

You can your system TFTP Server but for easy on and off the service so I use 3rd party TFTP Server.

#### TFTP server

you can download here <http://ww2.unime.it/flr/tftpserver>

#### MacOS build-in tftp (optional)

If you don't like to install 3rd party software you can use system TFTP Service

``` bash
sudo launchctl load -F /System/Library/LaunchDaemons/tftp.plist

sudo launchctl start com.apple.tftpd

cd /var/tftpboot touch # make initial tftp directory
```

#### Copy file to tftp folder

change mode your directory to allow other users to read and write files

``` bash
chmod 777 /private/tftpboot
```

copy the binary file into TFTP root directory

![copy the binary file into TFTP root directory](/img/in-post/2020-1-3-install-openwrt-on-banana-pi-r64/1.png)

### Connect to board by UART

use serial 115200 baud for Bananapi r64

`sudo screen /dev/cu.usbserial-A50285BI 115200`

replace `cu.usbserial-A50285BI` with your serial driver

### Set u-boot env

``` bash
setenv ipaddr 192.168.1.126 # your bpi ip address
setenv serverip 192.168.1.1 # your tfto server
setenv netmask 255.255.255.0
saveenv
```

[comment]: <> (load ROM to address 1080000)

[comment]: <> (`tftp 1080000 preloader_emmc.bin`)

check u-boot env

`printenv`

return to u-boot menu

`bootmenu`

### Write eMMC image to flash via TFTP

Put Ethernet to WLAN port for connect to the router

make sure your TFTP server in the same network with your bpi board

#### Install eMMC flash image to flash

in u-boot menu choose "b. System Load flash image then write to Flash via TFTP"

![b. System Load flash image then write to Flash via TFTP](/img/in-post/2020-1-3-install-openwrt-on-banana-pi-r64/2.png)

Set TFTP server IP and flash image file name

![Set TFTP server ip and flash image file name](/img/in-post/2020-1-3-install-openwrt-on-banana-pi-r64/3.png)

#### Install preloader to flash

back to U-Boot menu choose "7. System Load Preloader then write to Flash via TFTP"

![7. System Load Preloader then write to Flash via TFTP](/img/in-post/2020-1-3-install-openwrt-on-banana-pi-r64/4.png)

Set TFTP server IP address and preloader file name

![Set TFTP server ip and preloader file name](/img/in-post/2020-1-3-install-openwrt-on-banana-pi-r64/5.png)

Remove sd card and power-off The Banana pi, Remove SD card, and Power on.

Now you'll get U-BOOT installed on eMMC storage

## Build your OpenWRT image

### Preparation to build OpenWRT image

follow the link for more information
<https://openwrt.org/docs/guide-developer/buildroot.exigence.macosx>

#### Setup MacOSX as an OpenWrt build environment

Install these package by Homebrew

``` bash
brew install coreutils diffutils findutils gawk gnu-getopt gnu-tar grep wget quilt xz

# Link gnu-getopt to local gnugetopt
ln -s `brew --prefix gnu-getopt`/bin/getopt `brew --prefix`/bin/gnugetopt
```

add gnu-getopt to your path

``` bash
export PATH="/usr/local/opt/gnu-getopt/bin:$PATH"
```

#### Create case-insensitive filesystem

OS X by default comes with a case-insensitive filesystem. OpenWrt won't build on that. As a workaround, create a (Sparse) case-sensitive disk-image that you then mount in the finder and use as build directory

``` bash
hdiutil create -size 20g -type SPARSE -fs "Case-sensitive HFS+" -volname OpenWrt OpenWrt.sparseimage

# mount the image
hdiutil attach OpenWrt.sparseimage
```

change directory to /Volumes/OpenWrt

`cd /Volumes/OpenWrt`

### Build OpenWRT Image for MT7622

#### Clone OpenWRT project

`git clone https://github.com/openwrt/openwrt.git`

#### Set parametres

Target System: MediaTek Ralink ARM

Subtarget: MT7622

Target Profile: Banana Pi R64

``` bash
cd openwrt

./scripts/feeds update -a
./scripts/feeds install -a

make menuconfig
```

Set config and include built-in dependency that you want (Luci is not included by default)

then save to `.config`

#### Build OpenWRT image

``` bash
# for 10.15 need set deploy target it to 10.14
MACOSX_DEPLOYMENT_TARGET=10.14

# Start make
# vadd v1 mean verbose Level 1 (warnings/errors), level 99 (stdout+stderr)
# add -j4 mean use quard core
make -j4 V=1
```

Kernel image file will be at ./bin/targets/mediatek/mt7622/openwrt-mediatek-mt7622-bpi_bananapi-r64-initramfs-kernel.bin

#### Install OpenWRT Image to Bananapi via TFTP

Copy the kernel image to TFTP folder

`cp ./bin/targets/mediatek/mt7622/openwrt-mediatek-mt7622-bpi_bananapi-r64-initramfs-kernel.bin /private/tftpboot/`

Enter to the U-Boot menu

Install kernel image from TFTP

![Install kernel image from TFTP](/img/in-post/2020-1-3-install-openwrt-on-banana-pi-r64/8.png)

Finally, I got The OpenWRT image installed
